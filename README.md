## ❓ Problem

Creating forms for applications is often:

* 🕒 **Time-consuming** – Developers spend hours building even simple forms.
* 💻 **Code-heavy** – Requires repetitive frontend + backend integration.
* 🎨 **UI Inconsistent** – Styles differ from form to form.
* 📈 **Hard to Scale** – Adding new forms for different use cases is tedious.

## 💡 Solution – Dynamic Forms with AI

A **dynamic form** is an interactive form whose **structure, fields, and behavior** can change in real-time based on:

* 🖊 **User input**
* 📂 **Data from a database**
* 📜 **Predefined rules**

This means you **don’t** need to reload the page or hardcode every possible layout.
Instead of a fixed, one-size-fits-all form, a **dynamic form adapts to the situation**.

### 🔑 Key Characteristics of Dynamic Forms

* ⚙ **Configurable at runtime** – Add, remove, or modify fields, labels, and options instantly.
* 📊 **Data-driven** – Structures can be generated from JSON, a database schema, or API response.
* 🔄 **Conditional logic** – Show/hide fields based on previous answers (e.g., selecting “Yes” reveals more questions).
* ♻ **Reusable** – One component handles multiple form types by changing configuration.
* ✅ **Validation-aware** – Field validations update dynamically with the form structure.
